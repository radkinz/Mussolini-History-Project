# Mussolini-History-Project

A project for my European History class. Users can click buttons on a timeline about Mussolini's life and get information about each event.
An LED pin also lights up on a map that corresponds with the location of each event. The web application was made using Node.js, and the hardware was built with an Arduino.
The server code can trigger the Arduino to tell the LED pins to turn on/off using the Johnny-Five library. In order to connect the LEDs, a simple circuit was created using jumper wires and resistors. For the LED pins to extend into the map, a longer wire was soldered onto each LED end which then extended into the breadboard.
